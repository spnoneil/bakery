## _Description_
This an application built in C# with .NET 5.0 framework that will mimic a storefront, take user choice and input, and return a price based on those.

This is an independent project for practicing C#, SDK, .NET framework, and Classes for a course at Epicodus.

## _Use Guide_

> [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/spnoneil/bakery)
1. Clone/download the above repository from Github (unzip, if necessary).
2. Navigate to the Bakery.Tests directory in the terminal and run `dotnet restore` to build out test environment (can run `dotnet test` from this directory to check unit testing).
3. In your terminal, navigate to Bakery directory and run `dotnet build` to build application within directory. 
4. In your terminal, while still in Bakery directory, run `dotnet run` to run application within terminal.
3. Open the project in your text editor to view the code.

## _Software Installation_
### _MAC_
C# and .NET programming are fully supported on Mac operating systems. We can install .NET and C# on a Mac in a few steps:
* Download .NET Core SDK (Software Development Kit).
* Open the file. This will launch an installer which will walk you through installation steps. Use the default settings the installer suggests.

#### _Windows_
These Windows instructions assume you're using Windows 10. If you currently run Windows 7 or Windows 8, you may have a free upgrade available.

#### _Installation Steps_
* Download the 64-bit .NET Core SDK (Software Development Kit).
* Open the file and follow the steps provided by the installer for your OS.
* Confirm the installation is successful by opening a new Windows PowerShell window and running the command dotnet --version. You should see something a response like this (version numbers do not need to be the same): 5.0.102
* This means .NET and C# are installed and our computer recognizes the dotnet command.

## _Known Bugs_
